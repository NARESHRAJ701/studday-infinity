ONLINE MENTORING SYSTEM

Abstract:
Students nowadays find it difficult to track their academics properly. Students are visiting websites 
for resources, tracking time, and reaching out for help online. there is no existing app or website 
which gives all the features.
This app gives access to both mentors and mentees where mentors can guide the students and give 
remarks and resources based on their performance. We’ve used PyQt5 for the front end, matplotlib 
for plotting the progress, and SQL for the back end. The information of both mentors and mentees
will be stored in the database. The marks and progress will be stored in the xml file. Students can set 
targets and the student will be mentored to reach the target.
Mentors can remind the students to completion of tasks with an in-built calendar. Students can test 
their productivity by using a timer that tracks their study time. ML Algorithm is applied to track the 
progress of the students. Students can access resources that were being shared by mentors. ML 
code trains a simple linear regression model on the student's previous assignment grades and uses it 
to predict their grade on the next assignment. The predicted grade is then stored in the next 
assignment grade variable and could be displayed on the graph or in another part of the user 
interface.
The targeted audiences will be students and teachers
